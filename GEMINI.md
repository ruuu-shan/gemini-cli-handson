# GEMINI.md - Project Guidelines for Gemini CLI

This file provides guidelines and context for the Gemini CLI to effectively assist with this project.

## Project Overview

This is a simple Python Flask web application. The primary goal is to demonstrate basic web application development, dependency management, and Git integration using Gemini CLI.

## Development Requirements

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Entry Point**: `app.py` (main Flask application file)

## Project Structure (Expected)

```
./
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── GEMINI.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Key Tasks for Gemini CLI

- **Code Generation**: Create `app.py` and `requirements.txt`.
- **Dependency Management**: Install Python dependencies using `pip`.
- **Application Execution**: Run the Flask development server.
- **Git Operations**: Stage, commit, and push changes to GitHub.
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug common Python/Flask issues.

## How to Run the Application (for Gemini CLI)

1.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  Run the application: `python app.py` (or `flask run` if configured)

## Important Notes

- Always refer to `requirements.txt` for project dependencies.
- Ensure virtual environments are used for dependency management.
- Follow standard Python best practices (e.g., PEP 8).
